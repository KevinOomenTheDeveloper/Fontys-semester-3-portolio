## Software quality
### What is it?
With software quality we mean the assurance of the quality of the software. This is the process of testing your code so that if something would break you will be able to see it fast by checking the test instead of having to debug for the bug or even worse, not finding the bug until after deployment. This ofcourse would be very troublesome. Speaking of tests, there are a lot different sort of tests. To name a few:

* Unit tests
* Acceptation tests
* Integration tests
* static code analysis
* front to back testing

As you can see there are a lot of different types of tests and this is just a fraction. In this document we are mainly going to focus on: `Integration tests`, `Unit tests` and `static code analysis`.

## Personal development
I have learned a lot about tests this semester. I have learned how to create integration tests and how to implement static code analysis and I leaned how to create tests for Spring applications. I have learned how to implement `iegration tests` because of my group project and I learnedhow to use `stode analysis from a fellow classmate.
