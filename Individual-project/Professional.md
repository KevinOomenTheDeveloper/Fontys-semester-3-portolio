## Professional
### What is it?
This learning outcome is about the communication between the stakeholders. In this case the stakeholder will be my teacher Leon.

### The process
I started with the idea to create a cards against humanity application. Cards against humanity is a cards game made for people who like dark humor. The game works as follows: Everyone gets some white cards with phrases on them. Once the game starts a black card will be revealed with a blank space in the phrase. Evryone except for the dealer who switches roles clockwise each turn needs to lay down a white card trying to create the funniest sentence. The dealer will then choose the card he/she likes the best and the person from whom the card was wil get a point. After a few turns the person with the most points wins. This was my original idea. But after sometime of a lot of researching and checking how things work Leon and I cam to the conclussion that this goal wasn't reachable anymore. Which wasn't directly a bad thing because this semester mostley was about creating a professional software development environment. So we cam with a new plan: because I really wanted to implement `websockets` into my application. We came with the decision to create a chat application because this was also one of the original functionalities of the application. But because I also had to make some databse calls I cam up with the idea to create a logging page were every user could see all of the messages they send. Sadly enough it only came to this chat application being produced but I did learn a lot in the creation of it. I learned a lott about `websockets`, `Keycloak` and `cors` in the creation of this small but "complicated" application.

### DOT-framework documentation
I had to create 2 research documents aswell. Both of them had to be written in the DOT-framework standard. These are both of the documents:
#### [Authetication research]()
#### [integration test research]()

### [Feedpulse]()
