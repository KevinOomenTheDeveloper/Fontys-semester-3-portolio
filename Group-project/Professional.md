## Profesional
For this learning outcome I will show our `Jira board` and what have done for the group-project.
## Jira
This is our `Jira board backlog`. All of our finished and pending user stories are stored [here](../Group-project/Documents/Jira-backlog-semester-3). We have created these user stories according to our feedback and we have discussed what we would do every sprint. This way we kept the client's priorities clear and because of the communication we were able to create evrything the way the client wanted it.
