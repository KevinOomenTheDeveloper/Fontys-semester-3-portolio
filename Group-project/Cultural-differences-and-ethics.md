## Cultural differences and ethics
For this learning outcome I had to prove that I understood this subject. I did this by speaking to my teacher about the subject and by creating a document.
### Context
This learning outcome is about knowing that there are differences in norms and values. Because this could lead to bad situations if you are not prepared for intercultural transactions. It's about understanding the differences and knowing how to manage them.
### Prove
To prove that I understand this subject I have created [this](../Group-project/Documents/Cultural-differences-and-ethics-research.pdf) document, which proves that I mastered this learning outcome.
