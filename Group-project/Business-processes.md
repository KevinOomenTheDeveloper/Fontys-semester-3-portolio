## Business processes
For this learing outome I had to create and explain a business process diagram.

## Context
I made this business process diagram for our group project. In our group project, the stake holder wanted to know more about how changing the menu would work in a business perspective. So I made a business process diagram with someone else in my group for this problem. But because we worked on the diagram with 2 people we both needed to be able explain how the diagram worked. I have done this in the frm of a document.
