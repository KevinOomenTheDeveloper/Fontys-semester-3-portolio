# Group project
In this document I will give refrences to the proof for the learning outcomes of the group project

## Agile method
### Definition
>**Choose:**
>You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and >context analyses.
### [Proof](../Group-project/Agile-method.md)

## Business processes
### Definition
>**Simple:**
>Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

>**Related:**
>Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them). 
>or
>Business processes needed for the success of your software development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).
### [Proof](../Group-project/Business-processes.md)

### Requirements and Design
### Definition
>**Multiple types of test techniques:**
>You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) >taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.
### [Proof](../Group-project/Requirements-and-design.md)

## Cultural differences and Ethics
### Definition
>**Recognize:**
>Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

>**Take into account:**
>Adapt your communication, working, and behavior styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;
>Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.
### [Proof](../Group-project/Cultural-differences-and-ethics.md)

## Professional
### Definition
>**Professional manner:**
>You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.
>You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.
### [Proof](../Group-project/Profesional.md)

## Web application
### Defintion
>**User friendly:**
>You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

>**Full-stack:**
>You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing >and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.
### [Proof](../Group-project/Web-application.md)
